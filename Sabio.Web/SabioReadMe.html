                                to perform updates, inserts or deletes. More often than not, they will contain partial list of all the properties of the

                            Controllers act to execute the first layer of business logic in our application's 
                            request/response life cycle. They may receive a model as input parameters and will often engage 1 or more Service layer
                            classes to achieve their tasks.

                                    which we will refer to as "View Controllers" because they are invoked 
                               with the intent to have an entire <mark>View</mark> or HTML page returned in the response to the browser.
                                </p>

                                We will be using them exclusively to pass data to and from the web server from our HTML page.

                            Views are responsible for the UI of the application, the presentation. Any "business" logic that they may perform 
                            will be solely for the purpose of rendering an appropriate interface.
                            
                            They may receive a model, passed to it, from a View Controller.
                        </div>
                        <p>There are serveral types of View files. The all have an extension of .cshtml</p>

                                    These files are shared between the different Views of the application. You can think of them as the
                                    Template files for any given page.

                                    These files containHTML, CSS and Javascript mark that could be used to partially render a snippet of content from 
                                    within several different top level View files.

                                    Some shops would render a Partial View as an entire response via an Ajax request. The intent would be to place this 
                                    content within the existing DOM. We will <strong>NOT</strong> be using this technique because it is not very
                                    efficient.
